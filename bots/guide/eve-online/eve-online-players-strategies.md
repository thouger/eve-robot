> Do you think it might be interesting to implement a bounce of a random celestial where the route takes one through a system other than high sec?

> Its a standard strategy for trying to avoid gate campers deploying bubbles and smart bombs. Normally a traveler is expected to warp from gate to gate so his trajectory is reasonable foreseeable. Gate campers would often deploy bubbles on this trajectory or wait for a traveler to come out of warp on this trajectory. To avoid the trajectory traps we often warp from the system entry gate to some celestial and then from there to the exit gate. this changes the foreseeable trajectory and adds a bit of a safety margin. If its not a major development task it may be worth while considering.
