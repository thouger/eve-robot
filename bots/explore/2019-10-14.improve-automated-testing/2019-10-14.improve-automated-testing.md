# 2019-10-14 Improve Automated Testing

Based on experience working on these changes:

+ https://github.com/Viir/bots/commit/9929d49f4c38611181c08325d23bad5ef8a36cab
+ https://github.com/Viir/bots/commit/1b93524d8c43bd7a66d3c0cbd09a37eeaccc4534

Problems experienced there:

+ Process to extract the relevant portions from the sample files which were already present in the same repository:
  + So far, using `elm-test` to run tests.
  + The sample data (from https://github.com/Viir/bots/tree/1b93524d8c43bd7a66d3c0cbd09a37eeaccc4534/implement/applications/eve-online/training-data/2019-10-12.eve-online-mining) has to be made available to the Elm test function somehow. To solve this, test data was copied into the Elm module source code.
  + To avoid problems with parsing the Elm modules and with readability for humans, the sample data was not copied completely but reduced to portions which are relevant for the test.
  + Just removing contents before and after the part of the JSON tree containing the tested object was not sufficient; in some cases also removed superfluous elements within the subtree tree, which is parsed in the test. Not everything in there is parsed.
  + Ideally, we could reference the file we already have, instead of messing with the Elm source code.

How about using a test runner that supports referencing and loading files and propagating them into the tests?

We could describe a test in the Elm module like this:
```Elm
type alias FileTest =
    { name : String
    , source : String
    , passes : Bytes.Bytes -> Bool
    }


allTestsToRun : List FileTest
allTestsToRun =
    [ sample_7C3AE6AF_ship_UI_first_module
    ]


sample_7C3AE6AF_ship_UI_first_module : List FileTest
sample_7C3AE6AF_ship_UI_first_module =
    { name = "7C3AE6AF - First Ship UI Module"
    , source = "https://github.com/Viir/bots/blob/1b93524d8c43bd7a66d3c0cbd09a37eeaccc4534/implement/applications/eve-online/training-data/2019-10-12.eve-online-mining/2019-10-12.from-7C3AE6AF.reduced-with-named-nodes.only-shipui.json"
    , passes =
        (Bytes.Decode.decode Bytes.Decode.string
            |> Maybe.andThen (parseMemoryMeasurementFromJson >> Result.toMaybe)
            |> Maybe.andThen (.shipUi >> maybeNothingFromCanNotSeeIt)
            |> Maybe.map .modules
            |> Maybe.andThen List.head
        )
            == Just
                { uiElement = { id = 543723600, region = { left = 632, top = 539, right = 696, bottom = 603 } }
                , isActive = Just True
                }
    }
```

Note about the source in the example above: Since it specifies a commit hash, we do not need to load from the given address. Maybe we have the same commit in a local repository; then, we can get it from there. At the same time, having the URL in the code helps humans navigate.

This design should allow to only give the name of the compilation root module and the name of the `allTestsToRun` function to the test runner.
