# 2019-08-02 Interface to Host

When looking at the current interface between bot and host, some questions came up:

+ What does it mean when the `botRequests` contain multiple `FinishSession` entries? What is the difference to having just one `FinishSession` entry?
+ When `botRequests` contains tasks after a `FinishSession` entry, are these tasks started?
+ When a response contains a `StartTask` entry, is this task started even if the same response also contains a `FinishSession` entry?
+ What is the `Process` in `ProcessEventResponse`?
+ Why does the `Delay` task have a `taskId`? How would we use this id?
+ How does the bot specify that it is not interested anymore in `Delay` tasks it has started before? We can ignore the resulting events, but would it not be better to avoid having these events generated at all?
